&nbsp; I developed my first snake game almost four months ago I had little knowledge, I gained more experience and knowledge and ended up improving the game, I believe I got a result that made me happy.

&nbsp; I took out some bugs that were in the points count, which before would not work if the points were zero, etc.
Very cool game, it marked my childhood on Nokia phones


**Where I create applications that I learn over time, trying to keep updated as much as possible. If you can give me some tips I would be very grateful.**
